#### Note that the data sets except for `Spoof client` (Reddit client patch) in [options.json](options.json) are deprecated but won't cause any errors. For now, you'll have to manually create/edit them if you want them to be of any use. However, this can slightly [help](/README.md#patching) in that process.
